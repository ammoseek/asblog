Well, that didn't take long. In the immediate wake of the Democrats taking control of both houses in Virginia, Democratic VA governor Ralph Northam promises to start taking away your gun rights.

And by **your** I mean **our** because Virginia is said to be only the first state the left-leaning anti-gun millionaires will pour money into in an effort to put anti-gun politicians in office in order to strip us of our second amendment rights. On Tuesday, it worked in Virginia, so now they have a blueprint in place.

On Wednesday Northam [said in part on CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/politics/ralph-northam-democratic-control-virginia-gun-reform-cnntv/index.html):

>"Getting rid of bump stocks, high volume magazines, red flag laws. These are common-sense pieces of legislation. I will introduce those again in January and I'm convinced, with the majority now in the House and Senate, they'll become law and because of that, Virginia will be safer."

Will Virginia be safer? Nope. As other states that have these types of laws has shown, they are hollow, virtue-signaling measures that make politicians feel better about themselves. Meanwhile, law-abiding gun-owners get screwed and criminals still do what they do, break the laws: new ones and old ones. It doesn't matter.

Are these proposed laws, as Northam says, "common-sense pieces of legislation"? Nope.

For instance, one of the more insidious proposals, are so-called **Red Flag Laws**. These types of laws violate the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments in the Bill of Rights. As [described by the Virginia Citizens Defense League](https://www.vcdl.org/RedFlag) (VCDL):

>"...all of those violations of the Constitution based solely on an unnamed person's secret allegation that someone else "might" do something dangerous to themselves or others in the future. The State is supposed to punish those who have broken the law, not those who **might** break the law."

**Red Flag Laws** are the polar opposite of "common-sense" legislation, especially when looking at the potential unintended consequences. Lawmakers don't get paid to do that though, unfortunately.

Historically, Virginia has been one of the more second amendment friendly states. But now with all areas of the state government controlled by Democrats for the first time in 26 years, there is no longer a line of defense against these types of laws to be passed.

It is a sad time for gun-rights and freedom in Virginia.
