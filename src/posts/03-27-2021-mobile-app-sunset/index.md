We are sad to report that our native mobile app for both IOS and Android is going away.

**It will no longer be functional after May 31st, 2021.**

We did not make this decision lightly, though admittedly, the decision was not completely ours to make.

Google decided to remove the app from the Google Play Store back in 2018. The explanation was that it violated their terms of service by linking to violent content. Ammunition is inherently violent according to Google. Ok.

We made the Android app available in an alternate app store called Aptoide. This year the app disappeared from there as well. No explanation was provided.

For now, the mobile app is still available in Apple's IOS app store. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee it would remain there if we weren't planning on ceasing its opearation ourselves.

These actions by our "tech overlords" pushed us toward holding back on improving and updating the mobile app with new features and fixes. We just didn't want to devote time and effort to something that could be 'cancelled' at the whim of these other companies.

Because of this we have made special efforts to update the web version of AmmoSeek to be more user-friendly and "app-like" on mobile device web browsers. Admittedly, it isn't perfect in this regard, but it is far closer to an app-like experience than the previous version. Sufficiently enough for us to be comfortable making this decision.

Another contributing reason for us making this decision is that the mobile app (again, largely because of the above) has become extremely outdated and has a very limited feature set relative to the web site version. Having to support both "versions" has become overly labor-intensive.

If you are a frequent user of the mobile app please start adjusting to using the [AmmoSeek.com web site](https://ammoseek.com/) from your mobile web browser instead. The sun is setting on the mobile app.

If you have any questions/concerns about this decision that aren't merely unconstructive complaints, please [contact us](https://ammoseek.com/contact/) and we'll do our best to answer in a timely fashion.

Thank you!
