As gun-owners we know that guns are some of the most effective tools for self-defense. From Florida, comes a story that only reenforces this knowledge.

Two masked men armed with handguns entered a family's home and demanded money. The mother retreated, grabbed their AR-15 and shot at the intruders, hitting one. The intruders ran, and one was later found dead, while the other one got away.

The husband summed up the experience:

```Them guys came in with two normal pistols and my AR stopped it. (My Wife) evened the playing field and kept them from killing me.```
