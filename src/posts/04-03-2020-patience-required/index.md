Since March 12th, online ammunition retailers have been experiencing demand like never before in the history of the gun industry. Nope, not even the panic buying due to the concern over a potential gun ban during the Obama presidency has seen demand like we are seeing. It isn't an understatement to use the word 'insane' to describe it.

We all need to take a step back and realize most retailers are doing the very best they can to fulfill the influx of orders. It requires patience and understanding.

We live in the age of Amazon.com. We have been conditioned to expect online purchases to reach us within days, not weeks, or months. It wasn't too long ago when ordering via mail nearly always took 6-8 weeks to be delivered. Online ammunition retailers were not prepared to meet the demand caused by the COVID19 (coronovirus) outbreak. Because of this, we need to adjust our expectations.

If you order ammunition online (particularly [the most popular calibers](https://www.gunsandammo.com/editorial/pandemic-ammo-sales-whats-hot/374234)) as of this writing (April 3rd, 2020), you should prepare yourself for the following:

- A product page that shows an item as in-stock may not actually mean it will be in-stock once your order is processed.
- Your order may be cancelled and money refunded.
- Your order may be backordered/delayed.
- Your order may take longer to be delivered to you.
- You will likely pay a higher price for the same product you could have purchased cheaper just 2 months ago.

Obviously, there will be exceptions to the above. Consider yourself lucky if you order ammunition and your entire order reaches you within a week's time.

As time goes by, all of the above will return to normal. We'll see supply return, demand go down, and prices will come back to previous levels. However, for now, we are all going to have to channel some extra patience and understanding as we get through this unprecedented period in our lives.

All of this being said, [AmmoSeek.com](https://ammoseek.com/) works 24/7 to make sure we have the most up to date information showing in our search results as possible. We are doing the very best we can.

Stay safe. Stay healthy, and keep on shooting straight.
