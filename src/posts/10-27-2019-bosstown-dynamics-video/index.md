## Uh-oh, this is scary

Or are they? The robots are coming to murder us with our own ammunition! This is one of the latest CGI videos by the folks at [Corridor Digital](https://www.youtube.com/user/CorridorDigital/featured).

So no, it is not real. However, it certainly raises questions about our potential future when the robots come and take our guns and become our new dictators. And of course, the obvious comparisons to "Skynet" from the "Terminator".  Though Skynet may not be as far off as [some think](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/skynet-real_n_7042808).

For now, this is just a pretty cool video.
